# Week 1 Homework

## Connecting To Your Principles 
### Personal Values

Think about the things that are important to who you are. Some ideas to get your started are listed below (you don’t need to use these, they are only listed to help get you thinking).
* Honesty
* Being creative
* Making a strong impact on society
* Having a great sense of humor
* Having a strong connection with family and friends

Pick two or three of your most important values, and write about why they are important to you. What makes them matter to you? Explain how they define who you are. 

Start by taking notes or brainstorming a list of what you value. Then move to a computer and type up your response. For full credit your response should be around a page single-spaced, but feel free to write more. You may also include some graphics in your paper to help explain your values (this is not required).

### Notes
* You will earn full credit based on your sincere effort to complete the exercise not on the content of your writing
* Your writing will be private between you and the instructor, your response will not be shared with the class

### Submission
Your personal values paper should be submitted on [Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1099807/assignments/3544127) as a `.pdf`. If you need help creating a `.pdf` let us know.
