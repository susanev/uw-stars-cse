## Grading

The grade weighting is as follows:
* Programming assignments: 50%
* Final Project: 25%
* Participation: 25%

The programming assignments will include weekly individual and pair programming assignments, as well as your portfolio work to showcase your programming assignments.

If you have a problem with a grade you received or if you feel the grade you received is incorrect please email the instructor for an appointment to discuss the assignment and your grade in detail. 

The gradebook on Canvas will be updated regularly; please check it to be sure scores have been recorded correctly.

### Participation
Your participation grade will include your active participation in class, as well as your participation on Slack. We expect students to come to class with relevant ideas, and questions related to the class topics.

We expect participating students to be active participants in the learning process. The questions below are designed to help guide you.
* Do you make at least one excellent contribution (e.g., insight or question) to each class without monopolizing discussion?
* Do you give active nonverbal and verbal feedback?
* Do you refer to other students by name and react to their contributions?

#### Punctuality
We expect all students to arrive on time to class except for in cases of emergency. If you do arrive late, please respect the learning of other students and take a seat in the back putting forth great effort to reduce distracting other students when you arrive.

#### Participation Balance
In any group there will be those who speak more and those who speak less; this might be because of differences in personality, language fluency, or culture. Some people like to carefully think before they speak and some believe that interaction should be rapid and assertive.

* If you often find yourself dominating class discussions, or answering all of the instructors questions, try limiting yourself to 3 really good responses, to give others a chance to participate 
* Be mindful that others have important things to say too, but they may need a bit more time to speak
* Silence is okay, and sometimes needed for other students to feel comfortable speaking

### Late Work
Late work is not accepted unless under special circumstances. If you need to turn in an assignment late under special circumstances, please email the instructor to schedule a meeting in which we can discuss and determine if extra time is needed.

## Academic Conduct
All work in this class must be your own. We encourage you to use online resources to learn how to achieve new things, but we expect you to use these resources to learn to write your own code, rather than copying code you find online directly and submitting it as your own work.

### Academic Integrity
The essence of academic life revolves around respect not only for the ideas of others, but also their rights to those ideas. It is therefore essential that all of us engaged in the life of the mind take the utmost care that the ideas and expressions of ideas of other people always be appropriately handled, and, where necessary, cited. When ideas or materials of others are used, they must be cited. The format is not that important—as long as the source material can be located and the citation verified, it's OK. What is important is that the material be cited. In any situation, if you have a question, please feel free to ask. Please acquaint yourself with the University of Washington's resources on academic honesty.

### Copyright
All of the expressions of ideas in this class that are fixed in any tangible medium such as digital and physical documents are protected by copyright law as embodied in title 17 of the United States Code. These expressions include the work product of both: (1) your student colleagues (e.g., any assignments published here in the course environment or statements committed to text in a discussion forum); and, (2) your instructors (e.g., the syllabus, assignments, reading lists, and lectures). Within the constraints of "fair use," you may copy these copyrighted expressions for your personal intellectual use in support of your education here in the UW. Such fair use by you does not include further distribution by any means of copying, performance or presentation beyond the circle of your close acquaintances, student colleagues in this class and your family. If you have any questions regarding whether a use to which you wish to put one of these expressions violates the creator's copyright interests, please feel free to ask the instructor for guidance.

### Privacy
To support an academic environment of rigorous discussion and open expression of personal thoughts and feelings, we, as members of the academic community, must be committed to the inviolate right of privacy of our student and instructor colleagues. As a result, we must forego sharing personally identifiable information about any member of our community including information about the ideas they express, their families, lifestyles and their political and social affiliations. If you have any questions regarding whether a disclosure you wish to make regarding anyone in this course or in the university community violates that person's privacy interests, please feel free to ask the instructor for guidance.

Knowingly violating any of these principles of academic conduct, privacy or copyright may result in University disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct.

## Accessibility
To request academic accommodations due to a disability, please contact Disabled Student Services: 448 Schmitz, 206-543-8924 (V/TTY). If you have a letter from DSS indicating that you have a disability which requires academic accommodations, please present the letter to me so we can discuss the accommodations you might need in the class.

Academic accommodations due to disability will not be made unless the student has a letter from DSS specifying the type and nature of accommodations needed.
