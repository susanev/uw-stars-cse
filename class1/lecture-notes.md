# Lecture Notes
* Every piece of code you write needs to be inside of a class
* Class is executable only if it has a __main__ method
* Commands end with semicolons
* Escape sequences
* Your goal for all assignments is to reduce redundancy
* You want main to be short, and give an good overview of what your program does
* Java precedence
* Integer division
* Must declare a variable before you use it, but can't declare it twice
* Understanding assignment statements
* Three main data types (you will learn more later)

* Style notes
  * Classes start with a capital letter, no spaces, all other words in name are also capitalized
  * Methods start with lowercase letters, no spaces, all other words in name are capitalized
