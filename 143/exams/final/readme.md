| 6 | 10 | Collections Programming |
| 7 | 20 | Comparable class |
| 8 | 20 | Binary Trees |
| 9 | 20 | Linked Lists |

#### Tips
* Do the 20pt questions first, if you run out of time and do not get to these questions it will not be possible to pass the test
  * Use the mechanical problems as a break from the 20pt problems, if your brain needs it
* It's easy to make a mistake on the Binary Search Tree problem, and its difficult for the graders to award partial credit, do check this problem closely before moving on
  * Write the alphabet down on your paper (if you struggle with it, I do!)
  * You can verify by doing an inorder traversal and seeing if the output is ordered
* Practice, practice, practice the 10pt Collections Programming question, there are a lot of small syntax details that you need to get correct to get a high score
  * You will need to know when to use a HashSet vs a TreeSet
  * In order to use TreeSet or TreeMap keys the type must implement the Comparable interface, otherwise you should use HashSet or HashMap
  * Point does not implement Comparable
* Usually, the more difficult part of the 20pt Binary Tress question is figuring out the parameters for your private method; so put time and effort into determining your parameters
* Practice a lot for the Linked Lists questions, in the past students have lost the most points on this question
  * You cannot ask if curr.next != null unless you first know that curr is not null
* Sorted output usually means sorted structure
