# Plan
## Week 1

* Changes in this workshop
	* 5:00 – 6:30
	* Quiz/Practice Exam
	* Paired white-board exercises
	* Check-in meetings (for some)
		* My schedule is not flexible this quarter so I can not reschedule you if you need to miss a check-in meeting—instead you can come to another scheduled check-in meeting
		* M 4p – 5p
		* T 6:30p – 7:30p (not recommended!)
		* F 4p – 6:30p
	* Homework: submitted on canvas; usually due Fridays at 9pm; no late submissions accepted
	* If you want more time in this workshop, you can stay as late as 7:30 pm
	* If you need more or less support you absolutely must reach out and talk to me; I can not know if you are annoyed by the walk to class, or need more time in your check-in meetings unless you come talk to me
* Review syllabus and grading
* Reminders about academic misconduct
* [Quiz](quiz.md)
* [White-board Exercises](exercises.md)
